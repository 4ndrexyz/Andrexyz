**Home** is my ([codenime](https://codenime.xyz) a.k.a. 4ndrexyz) personal knowledge base. I made this project to have a place where I can put my personal documentations / notes / any references which works for me (so I don't have to open multiple tabs or sweeping through a whole article even though I already read it before). Most of it may be opinionated and not work for everyone, but feel free to explore and make use of the content here as your references if you find it useful.
